FINAL: QUESTION 4: FIXING A BAD SHARD KEY

Suppose you have a sharded collection final_exam.m202 in a cluster with 3 shards. To set up the problem, first initialize a cluster with 3 single-server shards (not replica sets) in the mongo shell using ShardingTest:

$ mongo --nodb
> config = { d0 : { smallfiles : "", noprealloc : "", nopreallocj : ""}, d1 : { smallfiles : "", noprealloc : "", nopreallocj : "" }, d2 : { smallfiles : "", noprealloc : "", nopreallocj : ""}};
> cluster = new ShardingTest( { shards : config } );
Then click "Initialize" in MongoProc, which will verify that you have 3 shards and then insert test data into final_exam.m202.

Unfortunately, even though your shard key {otherID: 1} has high cardinality, the data is not being distributed well among the shards. You have decided that a hashed shard key based on the _id field would be a better choice, and want to reconfigure the collection to use this new shard key. Once you have the cluster using the new shard key for final_exam.m202, test in MongoProc and turn in when correct.
